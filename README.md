The Detailed Page shows detailed information about a specific product. It displays the product image, title, price, description, and other category. Users can go back to the Products Page by tapping the back arrow.

### Search Page

The Search Page provides a search interface for users to find products based on their search queries. It includes an app bar with a text field where users can enter their search query.
